## 🚀 How it works

This project is divided into two parts:

1. Backend (food-explorer-backend folder)
2. Frontend (food-explorer-frontend folder)

💡 The Frontend needs the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### 🎲 Running the Server (Backend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:benhur3010/FoodExplorer-BackEnd.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd food-explorer-backend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# run the migration and seed
$ npm migrate

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The Server will start at port: 3333 - go to http://localhost:3333
```

---

#### 🧭 Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:benhur3010/FoodExplorer-FrontEnd.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd food-explorer-frontend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

```
